# Crosschain-ERC-20-Token-on-Wormhole
Wormhole ERC-20 Token platform is a cross-chain token exchange platform that allows users to transfer assets between different blockchains without having to go through a centralized exchange. 

##  It is a decentralized bridge that uses a variety of techniques, including proof-of-stake (PoS) and federated Byzantine fault tolerance (fBFT), to ensure the security of its transactions.

Wormhole supports a wide range of blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, Terra, Avalanche, and Oasis. It also supports a wide range of ERC-20 tokens.

To use Wormhole, users first need to create an account and deposit their assets into the bridge. Once their assets have been deposited, users can then choose the blockchain and token they want to transfer their assets to. Wormhole will then generate a wrapped token that represents the user's original asset on the target blockchain.

Once the wrapped token has been generated, users can then withdraw it from the bridge and use it on the target blockchain. To withdraw their original asset, users simply need to burn the wrapped token on the target blockchain.

Wormhole is a popular choice for cross-chain token transfers because it is fast, secure, and easy to use. It is also a relatively new platform, but it has quickly gained a reputation for being reliable and trustworthy.

Here are some of the benefits of using Wormhole:

Speed: Wormhole transactions are typically very fast, typically taking only a few minutes to complete.
Security: Wormhole uses a variety of techniques to ensure the security of its transactions, including PoS and fBFT.
